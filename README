S2E works with CyanogenMod (7,9 and 10)!
or ROMs with support run-init from /data/local/userinit.d/

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK ONLY! â€¨MAKE A FULL BACKUP BEFORE INSTALLING, THE APPLICATION CAN DAMAGE YOUR DEVICE.

The application installs a script, that allows you to move applications, data and some cache to sd-ext partition and back. You can specify what needs to be moved from within the application

Supports moving to sd-ext:
- App, Paid and Private app
- Applications data
- Dalvik and download cache

Supports mounting sd-ext as ext4

Moving Applications data (/data/data) to sd-ext - Lower performance!!!
